# 📘 EfficientNetB3 for Image Classification

This project demonstrates the implementation of **EfficientNetB3**, a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architecture, for multi-class image classification using TensorFlow and Keras. It uses **transfer learning** to fine-tune a pretrained model on a custom dataset, achieving high accuracy with fewer resources.

---

## 🔍 Project Highlights

* ✅ Pretrained **EfficientNetB3** architecture
* 🔄 Transfer learning and fine-tuning for performance gains
* 📊 Visualization of training (loss & accuracy curves)
* 🧠 Evaluation with classification metrics and confusion matrix
* 🖼️ Works with custom image datasets (multi-class support)

---

## 📁 Files

* `efficientnetb3.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook for training, evaluation, and visualization
* `README.md`: Project overview (you’re reading it!)
* (Optional) You can add the following folders for organization:

  * `data/` – for dataset (with `train/` and `val/` subfolders)
  * `models/` – for saved models
  * `outputs/` – for generated plots and results

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/efficientnetb3-classification.git
cd efficientnetb3-classification
```

2. **Install required packages:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Prepare your dataset:**

Structure your dataset as follows:

```
data/
├── train/
│   ├── class1/
│   ├── class2/
│   └── ...
└── val/
    ├── class1/
    ├── class2/
    └── ...
```

4. **Run the notebook:**

```bash
jupyter notebook efficientnetb3.ipynb
```

## 🧪 Dataset

You can use your own custom dataset or any public dataset (e.g., from Kaggle). Make sure it's organized in the required structure (see above). The model supports **multi-class classification**.

---

## 📈 Results

* The model demonstrates **high classification accuracy** with minimal overfitting.
* Training and validation metrics (accuracy and loss) are plotted.
* A **classification report** and **confusion matrix** provide deeper insight into model performance.
