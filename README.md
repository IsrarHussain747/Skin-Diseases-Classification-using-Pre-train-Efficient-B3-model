📘 EfficientNetB3 for Image Classification
This project demonstrates the implementation of EfficientNetB3, a powerful convolutional neural network architecture, for image classification tasks using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is fine-tuned on a custom dataset, leveraging transfer learning to achieve high accuracy with fewer resources.

🔍 Project Highlights
✅ Pretrained EfficientNetB3 architecture

🔄 Transfer learning and fine-tuning for improved performance

📊 Training visualization with loss/accuracy plots

🧠 Model evaluation with classification metrics and confusion matrix

🖼️ Works with custom image datasets (multi-class support)

📁 Files

(Optional) Add folders like data/, models/, or outputs/ for organization

🚀 How to Run
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/efficientnetb3-classification.git
cd efficientnetb3-classification
Install required packages:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Add your image dataset under a folder (e.g., data/train, data/val) with subfolders per class.

Run the notebook:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook efficientnetb3.ipynb
🧪 Dataset
Make sure your dataset is structured as follows:

kotlin
Copy
Edit
data/
├── train/
│   ├── class1/
│   ├── class2/
│   └── ...
└── val/
    ├── class1/
    ├── class2/
    └── ...
You can also use any public dataset like Kaggle datasets for testing.

📈 Results
The model achieves high accuracy with minimal overfitting. Visualization plots (loss and accuracy) and a classification report are generated to evaluate performance.
